// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:

// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing

// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes

= Deleting the default Smart Gateways

When you have configured {ProjectShort} for multiple clouds, you can delete the default Smart Gateways if they are no longer in use. The Service Telemetry Operator can remove `SmartGateway` objects that have been created but are no longer listed in the ServiceTelemetry `clouds` list of objects. Removal of SmartGateway objects that are not defined by the `clouds` parameter can be enabled by setting `cloudsRemoveOnMissing: true` in the `ServiceTelemetry` manifest.

TIP: If you do not want any Smart Gateways deployed, define an empty clouds object using the `clouds: {}` parameter.

WARNING: Enabling `cloudsRemoveOnMissing` will remove any manually created `SmartGateway` objects in the current namespace without any possibility to restore. The `cloudsRemoveOnMissing` parameter is therefore disabled by default.

.Procedure

To delete the Smart Gateways, complete the following steps:

. Define your `clouds` parameter with the list of cloud objects to be managed by the Service Telemetry Operator. For more information, see xref:clouds_installing-the-core-components-of-stf[].

. Edit the ServiceTelemetry object and add the `cloudsRemoveOnMissing` parameter:
+
----
apiVersion: infra.watch/v1beta1
kind: ServiceTelemetry
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  cloudsRemoveOnMissing: true
  clouds:
    ...
----

. Save the modifications.

. Verify that the Smart Gateways have been removed. This can take several minutes while the Operators reconcile the changes:
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get smartgateways
----
