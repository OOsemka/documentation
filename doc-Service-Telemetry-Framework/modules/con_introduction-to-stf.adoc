// <List assemblies here, each on a new line>

// This module can be included from assemblies using the following include statement:
// include::<path>/con_overview-of-stf.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// The file name and the ID are based on the module title. For example:
// * file name: con_my-concept-module-a.adoc
// * ID: [id='con_my-concept-module-a_{context}']
// * Title: = My concept module A
//
// The ID is used as an anchor for linking to the module. Avoid changing
// it after the module has been published to ensure existing links are not
// broken.
//
// The `context` attribute enables module reuse. Every module's ID includes
// {context}, which ensures that the module has a unique ID even if it is
// reused multiple times in a guide.
//
// In the title, include nouns that are used in the body text. This helps
// readers and search engines find information quickly.
// Do not start the title with a verb. See also _Wording of headings_
// in _The IBM Style Guide_.

= Introduction to {Project}

{Project} ({ProjectShort}) provides automated collection of measurements and data from remote clients - {OpenStack} or third-party nodes - and transmission of that information to a centralized, receiving {OpenShift} ({OpenShiftShort}) deployment for storage, retrieval, and monitoring. The data can be either of two types:

* Metric - a numeric measurement of an application or system
* Event - irregular and discrete occurrences that happen in a system

The collection components that are required on the clients are lightweight. The multicast message bus that is shared by all clients and the deployment provides fast and reliable data transport. Other modular components for receiving and storing data are deployed in containers on {OpenShiftShort}.

{ProjectShort} provides access to monitoring functions such as alert generation, visualization via dashboards, and single source of truth telemetry analysis to support orchestration.
